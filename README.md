Running Route Recommendation System <br>
<br>
This is a project done in 4 weeks during the 2014 NYC session of Insight Data Science Program.<br> 
--Designed and created iRun (http://irunboston.net/), a web-based application that recommends the best running route given
starting and ending location, and the desired running distance.<br> 
--Cleaned and structured map data from OpenStreetMap into PostgreSQL to allow real-time data processing.<br> 
--Graded each route based on features affecting runner experience. Fine-tuned the scoring algorithm by numerical simulation,and recommend the best route.<br> 
--Designed a running route search algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulation, and implemented it in Python.<br>
